This repo was created for a GitHub brownbag that collected [First Internet Experiences](https://github.com/rebeccawilliams/internet/blob/master/experiences.md) as a way to [Learn GitHub](https://github.com/rebeccawilliams/internet/blob/master/LearnGitHub.md).

New to GitHub and scared? This is a safe space. Sign up, click "edit" on `Experiences.md` to add your experience, and boom you're using GitHub. Also, edit typos and ideas, go wild.
